Hello! I'm @artisdoingstuff, but you may call me Scott for formal matters.
I've been learning how to code since the midst of pandemic in 2020 and have fallen in love with it ever since.
My primary programming languages are Python and C#, but I am able to learn others (just for what I'd need to know) in a pretty short period.

I'm interested in a lot of things, especially programming related â€” since this is GitHub, that's the main focus. My interests include:
- Optimizing code (this is usually due to me spaghettifying my own work 90% of the time)
- Learning new languages (currently learning more about C++)
- Trying out new things (this is normal, of course anyone would love experimenting)
- And messing around with databases (SQLite or MySQL for now)

Anyways! That's all about me.
